Robotic approaches to surgery are less invasive and faster, and are often associated with improved clinical outcomes, such as decreased recovery time and reduced pain. Robotic approaches to surgery also guide surgeons in the operating room. Currently, robotic surgery is used in a gamut of procedures from spine to endovascular.

For instance, the da Vinci Surgical System, which is probably the best-known robotic surgery platform, translates the surgeon's hand movements to smaller movements made by the robot inside the body, all visualized via laparoscopy. The da Vinci System has been used on more than 3 million patients globally.">

In particular, this technology helps detect hemorrhagic stroke, which—although less common than ischemic stroke—accounts for 40% of stroke deaths.">

With its immersive approach, VR/MR is good for all kinds of learners: audio, visual, and kinesthetic.

VR is a completely computer-generated version of the world and requires the use of VR goggles. MR, or augmented reality, superimposes computer-generated images or sounds onto real-world settings and needs only be displayed on a screen.

VR/MR permits medical students to experience and learn from life-and-death scenarios in a low-stakes environment. Other applications of VR/MR include surgical simulation and diagnostic imaging.">

The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.

Although AI technologies have matched human performance of tasks, such as mathematical calculations or playing chess, they have yet to match human adeptness at covering wide domains of information.

With respect to health care, AI can assist medical diagnosis and aid physicians in identifying pathology on diagnostic scans. Furthermore, AI can help interpret mounds of electronic health data.">

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the coronavirus disease 2019<br>(COVID-19) a
pandemic[1]. A global coordinated effort is needed to stop the further spread of the virus. A pandemic is defined as "occurring over a wide geographic area and affecting an exceptionally high proportion of the population."[2] The last pandemic reported in the world was the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009.

On 31 December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province in China, was reported to the World Health Organisation. In January 2020, a previously unknown new virus was identified[3][4], subsequently named the 2019 novel coronavirus, and samples obtained from cases and analysis of the virus' genetics indicated that this was the cause of the outbreak. This novel coronavirus was named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO in February 2020.[5] The virus is referred to as SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease is COVID-19[6].

As of 15 May 2020, over 4,444,670 cases have been identified globally in 188 countries with a total of over 302,493 fatalities. Also 1,588,858 were recovered Live data can be accessed here.

nfection is the most common form of disease in Pakistan, since it occurs on the basis of co-infection. Contamination, poor sanitation, fewer resources and lack of medication are the main factors behind infection. The fact that Pakistan is still a developing country does not do much to help either. Additionally, intestinal infections include cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery, food poisoning and diarrhea among others.

Hepatitis A is a viral disease spreads through contaminated water or unhealthy food. It occurs as a result of poor sanitation and care of local produce. Its symptoms include fever, jaundice and diarrhea and it deteriorates the liver functions. Hepatitis E is another viral disease, also affecting the liver functions. Contaminated water is its primary cause for spreading. Furthermore, it may disrupt the urinary tract as well as display other symptoms such as jaundice or fatigue.

Malaria, dengue fever and yellow fever are the three most common mosquito borne diseases that occur in Pakistan. Malaria occurs when female mosquitoes transmit parasites in the liver and attack red blood cells. Severe chills, sweats and high fever are common symptoms. Dengue fever is a severe form of virus that causes migraines, chills and loss of strength and appetite. Furthermore, it may cause hospitalization and become lethal if not treated in time. However, yellow fever is perhaps the most severe form of mosquito-borne diseases. It causes viral infection of the respiratory passages. Fever and, in severe cases, hepatitis or hemorrhagic fever may occur.

Cancer is arguably, one of the leading causes of death in Pakistan, representing 8% of all deaths. Lung cancer and breast cancer are the two most common types of cancer in Pakistan. Majority of Pakistan's cancer patients do not have access to proper treatment. Furthermore, there are very few treatment centers as it is, with a lack of proper healthcare and medical facilities. Additionally, there is the lack of education and awareness regarding cancer as well. Therefore, patients are not treated until they reach critical stages of cancer, after which treatment becomes ineffective and they are unable to be cured in time.

The lack of health and nutrition is an apparent phenomenon in Pakistan. The food that is consumed swims in fat, comes from questionable sources, and is smothered in salt or sugar. Furthermore, the advent of processed food worsens matters further. Diabetes occurs when the body becomes incapable of producing insulin, resulting in low metabolism and high glucose levels in the blood and urine. Pakistan has the highest diabetes rates in all of South Asia, with as many as 7 million people affected by the disease.

A stroke is when blood flow to the brain is disrupted. There are typically two types of strokes, namely, ischemic and hemorrhage. Ischemic is when a blood vessel or artery is stopped by a blood clot and is unable to reach the brain. Hemorrhage results in internal bleeding of the brain due to rupture of a brain blood vessel. It is a major cause of death in Pakistan.

All in all, there are several hospitals in Pakistan that are capable of providing adequate treatment for these diseases. However, they are still very few in number, due to the lack of capable doctors and medical facilities. Furthermore, the government needs to play its role in providing access to more hospitals and awareness regarding lethal diseases, so that people can get treatment done in time.

          Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illness such as respiratory diseases or gastrointestinal diseases. Respiratory diseases can range from the common cold to more severe diseases eg
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV)[10].
A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been identified in humans previously. Once scientists determine exactly what coronavirus it is, they give it a name (as in the case of COVID-19, the virus causing it is SARS-CoV-2).

Coronaviruses got their name from the way that they look under a microscope. The virus consists of a core of genetic material surrounded by an envelope with protein spikes. This gives it the appearance of a crown. The word Corona means "crown" in Latin.

Coronaviruses are zoonotic[11], meaning that the viruses are transmitted between animals and humans. It has been determined that MERS-CoV was transmitted from dromedary camels to humans and SARS-CoV from civet cats to humans[10].  The source of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is yet to be determined, but investigations are ongoing to identify the zoonotic source to the outbreak[12].

         <h4>1. Wash your hands frequently and carefully</h4>
Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists, between your fingers, and under your fingernails. You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral soap.

Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day, especially after touching anything, including your phone or laptop.
<h4>2. Avoid touching your face</h4>
SARS-CoV-2 can live on some surfaces for up to 72 hours. You can get the virus on your hands if you touch a surface like:

gas pump handle
your cell phone
a doorknob
Avoid touching any part of your face or head, including your mouth, nose, and eyes. Also avoid biting your fingernails. This can give SARS-CoV-2 a chance to go from your hands into your body.

<h4>3. Stop shaking hands and hugging people — for now</h4>
Similarly, avoid touching other people. Skin-to-skin contact can transmit SARS-CoV-2 from one person to another.

<h4>4. Don't share personal items</h4>
Do not share personal items like:

phones
makeup
combs
It's also important not to share eating utensils and straws. Teach children to recognize their reusable cup, straw, and other dishes for their own use only.

<h4>5. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze</h4>
SARS-CoV-2 is found in high amounts in the nose and mouth. This means it can be carried by air droplets to other people when you cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also land on hard surfaces and stay there for up to 3 days.

Use a tissue or sneeze into your elbow to keep your hands as clean as possible. Wash your hands carefully after you sneeze or cough, regardless.

<h4>6. Clean and disinfect surfaces</h4>
Use alcohol-based disinfectants to clean hard surfaces in your home like:

countertops
door handles
furniture
toys
Also, clean your phone, laptop, and anything else you use regularly several times a day.

Disinfect areas after you bring groceries or packages into your home.

Use white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide solutions for general cleaning in between disinfecting surfaces.

<h4>7. Take physical (social) distancing seriously</h4>
If you're carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it'll be found in high amounts in your spit (sputum). This can happen even if you don't have symptoms.

Physical (social) distancing, also means staying home and working remotely when possible.

If you must go out for necessities, keep a distance of 6 feet (2 m) from other people. You can transmit the virus by speaking to someone in close contact to you.

<h4>8. Do not gather in groups</h4>
Being in a group or gathering makes it more likely that you'll be in close contact with someone.

This includes avoiding all religious places of worship, as you may have to sit or stand too close to another congregant. It also includes not congregating at parks or beaches.

<h4>9. Avoid eating or drinking in public places</h4>
Now is not the time to go out to eat. This means avoiding restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and other eateries.

The virus can be transmitted through food, utensils, dishes, and cups. It may also be temporarily airborne from other people in the venue.

You can still get delivery or takeaway food. Choose foods that are thoroughly cooked and can be reheated.

High heat (at least 132°F/56°C, according to one recent, not-yet-peer-reviewed lab study) helps to kill coronaviruses.

This means it may be best to avoid cold foods from restaurants and all food from buffets and open salad bars.

<h4>10. Wash fresh groceries</h4>
Wash all produce under running water before eating or preparing.

The CDCTrusted Source and the FDATrusted Source do not recommend using soap, detergent, or commercial produce wash on things like fruits and vegetables. Be sure to wash hands before and after handling these items.

<h4>11. Wear a (homemade) mask</h4>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendsTrusted Source that almost everyone wears a cloth face mask in public settings where physical distancing may be difficult, such as grocery stores.

When used correctly, these masks can help prevent people who are asymptomatic or undiagnosed from transmitting SARS-CoV-2 when they breathe, talk, sneeze, or cough. This, in turn, slows the transmission of the virus.

The CDC's website provides instructionsTrusted Source for making your own mask at home, using basic materials such as a T-shirt and scissors.

Some pointers to keep in mind:

Wearing a mask alone will not prevent you from getting a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Careful handwashing and physical distancing must also be followed.
Cloth masks aren't as effective as other types of masks, such as surgical masks or N95 respirators. However, these other masks should be reserved for healthcare workers and first responders.
Wash your hands before you put on your mask.
Wash your mask after each use.
You can transfer the virus from your hands to the mask. If you're wearing a mask, avoid touching the front of it.
You can also transfer the virus from the mask to your hands. Wash your hands if you touch the front of the mask.
A mask shouldn't be worn by a child under 2 years old, a person who has trouble breathing, or a person who can't remove the mask on their own.
<h4>12. Self-quarantine if sick</h4>
Call your doctor if you have any symptoms. Stay home until you recover. Avoid sitting, sleeping, or eating with your loved ones even if you live in the same home.

Wear a mask and wash your hands as much as possible. If you need urgent medical care, wear a mask and let them know you may have COVID-19.

Most people who become ill with COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. No specific treatments for COVID-19 exist right now. But some of the same things you do to feel better if you have the flu — getting enough rest, staying well hydrated, and taking medications to relieve fever and aches and pains — also help with COVID-19.

In the meantime, scientists are working hard to develop effective treatments. Therapies that are under investigation include drugs that have been used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases; antiviral drugs that were developed for other viruses, and antibodies from people who have recovered from COVID-19

The best ways to prevent gastrointestinal infection include:

Proper hand-washing
Disinfecting of contaminated surfaces with bleach
Washing of soiled articles of clothing
Identifying infected patients as soon as possible to implement extended infection control
There are no vaccines for most gastrointestinal infections. Exceptions:
Rotavirus
Adenovirus (limited availability)
For C. difficile: avoid prescribing antibiotics unnecessarily

In most cases, self-care measures are the recommended treatment. Antibiotics will not help GI infections from viruses or parasites.

Although antibiotics can help with complicated cases of bacterial infection, in uncomplicated cases, antibiotics may actually prolong the condition and increase risk of relapse.

Additionally, in certain infections, antibiotics may lead to dangerous complications. Your doctor can help determine if you or your child need antibiotics.

Your doctor might recommend that you stay away from high-fiber foods that could make diarrhea worse. They might also recommend over-the-counter medications that neutralize stomach acid or that treat nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

The most important self-care treatment for adults and children with a GI infection is to stay hydrated.

How is hepatitis E prevented?
Prevention of hepatitis E relies primarily on good sanitation and the availability of clean drinking water. Travelers to developing countries can reduce their risk for infection by not drinking unpurified water. Boiling and chlorination of water will inactivate HEV. Avoiding raw pork and venison can reduce the risk of HEV genotype 3 transmission. Immune globulin is not effective in preventing hepatitis E

Rest
Eat healthy foods
Drink lots of water
Avoid alcohol
Check with your doctor before you take any medicine that may damage your liver, such as acetaminophen.
If you're pregnant, your doctor may keep you under watch in the hospital. If your condition is serious, you may get medicine to fight the infection.

There are a number of things you can do to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.

Wear protective clothing; long sleeves and long pants in light colours are best. Mosquitoes are attracted to darker colours.
It is often a good idea to avoid being outdoors between dawn and dusk.
Treat your clothes and mosquito nets with an insect repellent containing permethrin. Permethrin paralyses and kills mosquitoes if they eat or touch it. It is also toxic to cats. Spray permethrin on your clothing and mosquito nets or soak clothes and bed nets in permethrin wash. It is also possible to buy clothes that have been pre-treated with permethrin. Be careful not to let the clothing touch your eyes and mouth.
On your skin, use insect repellents containing DEET (preferably more than 20 per cent) or picaridin. DEET and picaridin don't kill mosquitoes but stop them from being able to smell (and so bite) you. Repellents should be applied to exposed areas of skin but be careful to wash your hands after application and do not touch your eyes and mouth.
Always try to stay in accommodation that has insect screens over the windows and doors and mosquito netting over the beds.
Mosquito coils can be burned and offer some protection for approximately 6 hours.
Indoors, use plug-in mosquito zappers, which release insecticide at low levels for several hours.
Sleep in air conditioned rooms where possible, as this reduces the risk of mosquito activity.

At present, type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented. The environmental triggers that are thought to generate the process that results in the destruction of the body's insulin-producing cells are still under investigation.

While there are a number of factors that influence the development of type 2 diabetes, it is evident that the most influential are lifestyle behaviours commonly associated with urbanization. These include consumption of unhealthy foods and inactive lifestyles with sedentary behaviour. Studies from different parts of the world have established that lifestyle modification with physical activity and/or healthy diet can delay or prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes.

Modern lifestyles are characterised by physical inactivity and long sedentary periods. Community-based interventions can reach individuals and families through campaigns, education, social marketing and encourage physical activity both inside and outside school and the workplace. IDF recommends physical activity at least between three to five days a week, for a minimum of 30-45 minutes.

Taking a life course perspective is essential for preventing type 2 diabetes and its complications. Early in life, when eating and physical activity habits are established and when the long-term regulation of energy balance may be programmed, there is an especially critical window to prevent the development of overweight and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Healthy lifestyles can improve health outcomes at later stages of life as well.

Population based interventions and policies allow healthy choices through policies in trade, agriculture, transport and urban planning to become more accessible and easy. Healthy choices can be promoted in specific settings (school, workplace and home) and contribute to better health for everyone. They include exercising regularly and eating wisely which will help to maintain normal levels of blood glucose, blood pressure and lipids.

Diabetes is a serious disease that you cannot treat on your own. Your doctor will help you make a diabetes treatment plan that is right for you -- and that you can understand. You may also need other health care professionals on your diabetes treatment team, including a foot doctor, nutritionist, eye doctor, and a diabetes specialist (called an endocrinologist).


Treatment for diabetes requires keeping close watch over your blood sugar levels (and keeping them at a goal set by your doctor) with a combination of medications, exercise, and diet. By paying close attention to what and when you eat, you can minimize or avoid the "seesaw effect" of rapidly changing blood sugar levels, which can require quick changes in medication dosages, especially insulin.

<b>1.</b>Control high blood pressure (hypertension). Know your numbers and keep them low.<br><br>
<b>2.</b>Quit tobacco. Smoking raises the risk of stroke.<br><br>
<b>3.</b>Control diabetes. You can manage diabetes with diet, exercise, weight control and medication.<br><br>  
<b>4.</b>Manage a healthy weight. Being overweight contributes to other stroke risk factors such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Weight loss of as little as 10 pounds may lower your blood pressure and improve your cholesterol levels.<br><br>
<b>5.</b>Eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. A diet containing five or more daily servings of fruits or vegetables may reduce your risk of stroke.<br><br>
<b>6.</b>Exercise. Exercise can lower your blood pressure, increase your level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and improve the overall health of your blood vessels and heart. It also helps you lose weight, control diabetes and reduce stress.<br><br>
<b>7.</b>Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. Heavy alcohol consumption increases your risk of high blood pressure, ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes.<br><br>
<b>8.</b>Treat obstructive sleep apnea, if present. Your health care provider may recommend an overnight oxygen assessment to screen for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If obstructive sleep apnea is detected, it may be treated by giving you oxygen at night or having you wear a small device in your mouth.<br><br>
<b>9.</b>Avoid illicit drugs. Certain street drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamines, are established risk factors for a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a stroke.<br><br>
<b>10.</b>Manage other medical conditions. If you have any of these conditions, seek treatment to help reduce your risk of stroke: high cholesterol, carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease, atrial fibrillation (AFib), heart disease or sickle cell disease.

Proper medical evaluation and prompt treatment are vital to recovering from a stroke. According to the American Heart Association, "Time lost is brain lost." Call 911 as soon as you realize you may be having a stroke, or if you suspect a loved one is having a stroke.

<h3>Treatment for stroke depends on the type of stroke:</h3>

<h4>Ischemic stroke and TIA</h4>
These stroke types are caused by a blood clot or other blockage in the brain. For that reason, they're largely treated with similar techniques, which include:

<h4>Antiplatelet and anticoagulants</h4>
Over-the-counter aspirin is often a first line of defense against stroke damage. Anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs should be taken within 24 to 48 hours after stroke symptoms begin.

<h4>Clot-breaking drugs</h4>
Thrombolytic drugs can break up blood clots in your brain's arteries, which still stop the stroke and reduce damage to the brain.

One such drug, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), or Alteplase IV r-tPA, is considered the gold standard in ischemic stroke treatment. It works by dissolving blood clots quickly, if delivered within the first 3 to 4.5 hours after symptoms of your stroke began. People who receive a tPA injection are more likely to recover from a stroke, and less likely to have any lasting disability as a result of the stroke.

<h4>Mechanical thrombectomy</h4>
During this procedure, the doctor inserts a catheter into a large blood vessel inside your head. They then use a device to pull the clot out of the vessel. This surgery is most successful if it's performed 6 to 24 hours after the stroke begins.

<h4>Stents</h4>
If your doctor finds where artery walls have weakened, they may perform a procedure to inflate the narrowed artery and support the walls of the artery with a stent.

<h4>Surgery</h4>
In the rare instances that other treatments don't work, your doctor may perform surgery to remove a blood clot and plaques from your arteries. This may be done with a catheter, or if the clot is especially large, your doctor may open an artery to remove the blockage.
